# Introduction #

There goes my master's thesis on Molecular Dynamics: simulation of polymers
in Lennard-Jones potential.

So far it's only in Polish, but a translated version will follow.

Parts of my thesis were also included in a [publication](http://www.actaphys.uj.edu.pl/_old/vol38/pdf/v38p1727.pdf) (this time in English) by dr Michał Cieśla and prof Lech Longa.
